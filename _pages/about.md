I am currently working as an Advanced Research Scientist at the renowned Palo Alto Research Center ([PARC](https://www.parc.com/)), part of [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/) (Stanford Research Institute). At PARC-SRI, I am involved in several government and commercially funded interdisciplinary projects in the area of Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Motion Planning, Controls, Optimization, and Signal Processing. I graduated with a Ph.D. from the Department of Aerospace Engineering at [Texas A&M University](https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace) in 2020 with a focus on optimal control of soft robotics using data-driven reinforcement learning approaches. I completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee ([IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/)) in 2013.

**Research Interest:**
* Motion Planning and Feedback Control for Autonomous Systems
* Enhancing Privacy and Security Against Adversarial Attacks in Autonomous Systems
* System-level Design and Control of Deployable Space Systems
* Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for High-DOF Robotic Systems
* Machine Learning-enhanced Digital Twin Models for Dynamical Systems
* AI-driven Digital Twin Infrastructure for System Health Diagnosis and Prognosis
* Optimal Sensing/Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification for Dynamical Systems
* Machine Learning-assisted Signal Processing for Development of Novel Sensor Systems
* Agentic Integration of Foundational Models (LLMs) with Optimization
