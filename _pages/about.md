I am currently working as an Advanced Computer Scientist at the renowned Palo Alto Research Center ([PARC](https://www.parc.com/)), part of [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/). At PARC-SRI, I am involved in several government and commercially funded interdisciplinary data science projects in the area of Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Motion Planning, Controls & Optimization. I graduated with a Ph.D. from the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University in 2020 with a focus on optimal control of soft robotics using data-driven reinforcement learning approaches. I completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IIT Roorkee) in 2013.
