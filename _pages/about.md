I am currently working as an Advanced Computer Scientist at the renowned Palo Alto Research Center ([PARC](https://www.parc.com/)), part of [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/). At PARC-SRI, I am involved in several government and commercially funded interdisciplinary data science projects in the area of Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Motion Planning, Controls & Optimization. I graduated with a Ph.D. from the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University in 2020 with a focus on optimal control of soft robotics using data-driven reinforcement learning approaches. I completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IIT Roorkee) in 2013.

**Research Interest:**
* Motion Planning and Feedback Control for Autonomous Systems
* Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for High-DOF Robotic Systems
* Optimal Sensing/Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification for Dynamical Systems
* Machine Learning-enhanced Digital Twin Models for Dynamical Systems
* AI-driven Digital Twin Infrastructure for System Health Diagnosis and Prognosis
* Enhancing Privacy and Security Against Adversarial Attacks in Autonomous Systems
* Machine Learning-assisted Innovation in Novel Sensor Systems
* System-level Design and Optimization of Autonomous Systems
